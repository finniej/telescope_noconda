# telescope_noconda
Implementation of Telescope without Conda

This script has been developed for the implementation of Telescope (https://github.com/mlbendall/telescope) on Compute Canada's servers. This is not intended to be run directly! Instead, use the instructions.txt file as step by step instructions. The requirements.txt file shows the version numbers for dependencies that worked for me!
